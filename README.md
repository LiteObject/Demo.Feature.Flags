# Demo Feature Flags

## About
This repository contains a demo project illustrating the implementation and usage of feature flags in a .NET application. Feature flags, also known as feature toggles or feature switches, are a software development technique that allows you to enable or disable certain features or functionality in your application without deploying new code.

The `Demo.Feature.Flags` project demonstrates how to incorporate feature flags into your codebase, providing a way to control the availability of features at runtime. This approach can be beneficial in scenarios such as:

- Canary releases or gradual rollouts of new features
- A/B testing or experimentation with different feature variants
- Selectively enabling features for specific users, environments, or conditions
- Turning features on or off without redeploying the entire application

The project includes examples of how to define feature flags, how to check their status in the application code, and how to manage the configuration and state of these flags. It may also showcase integration with feature management services or libraries that simplify the process of managing feature flags at scale.

By exploring this demo project, developers can learn best practices for implementing feature flags, understand the benefits and trade-offs of this technique, and gain insights into how to incorporate feature flags into their own applications for better control over feature releases and experimentation.
