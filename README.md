# Demo Feature Flags
A Feature Flag service is a software tool that allows you to enable or disable features in your application without having to redeploy the entire codebase. It acts as a control panel where you can turn specific features on or off for different users, environments, or segments of your user base.

The main purpose of a Feature Flag service is to facilitate controlled rollouts, A/B testing, and safe deployments of new features. It decouples feature release from code deployment, giving you more flexibility and control over the release process.

## Decouple our code from their-party libraries

To isolate third-party libraries in our code and make it easier to change vendors, we can use the following approach:

1. __Dependency Inversion Principle__: Instead of directly using the third-party library in our code, create an interface or abstract class that defines the contract for the functionality we need. Then, implement this interface/abstract class using the third-party library.
2. __Dependency Injection__: Instead of creating instances of the third-party library directly in our code, use dependency injection to inject the implementation of the interface/abstract class we created. This way, we can easily swap out the implementation with a different one if needed.
3. __Facade Pattern__: Create a facade class that wraps the third-party library and exposes only the functionality we need. This way, our code only interacts with the facade class, and we can easily replace the underlying third-party library without affecting the rest of our code.

By following these principles and patterns, we can decouple our code from the specific third-party library, making it easier to change vendors or upgrade to a new version of the library without having to modify your entire codebase.
